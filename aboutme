hey, my name is Alex but you can also call me Lexi, DIO and others!
I'm a trans, pan, asexual guy, taken by my lovely boyfriend!
I love all of my friends ( platonically ), I usually hang out with them ( in games ), don't be scared to say hello! ( I don't bite! )
I'm learning how to animate, compose music, tips would be greatly appreciated!
